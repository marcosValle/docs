**DISCLAIMER: This doc is a living beast.**

## Ground rules for us

**#1 Trust is at the core our relationship.** You can count on me for anything you need, wether it is a professional or personal issue. My goal as a manager is to support you in thriving at this job, by removing blockers and directing your efforts towards our team needs and your personal goals. *“Trust is Built in Drops and Lost in Buckets” (Some Dutch fellow)*

**#2 Respect**. It goes without saying that we should not tolerate any kind of discrimination regarding race, gender, religion, or nationality. I truly respect who you are and will make sure that you feel safe and comfortable to express your ideas, feelings and true colors.

**#3 No surprises rule.** Anything can happen, but we should talk about it before it happens. We’ll have weekly catch ups to sync. I’ll let you know about any risks, and give you timely feedback. I expect the same from you. If there is *anything* that is making you uncomfortable, let’s talk about it ASAP. Do NOT postpone important conversations.

**#4 You. Own. Your. Work.** Autonomy and accountability follow from it. *“With great power comes great responsibility” (Uncle Ben)*

**#5 All in**. You did not get here by chance. You came a long way to get here. You have been selected from a global pool of hundreds of top-notch candidates. Let’s make it worth it. Let’s build the best pentest team ever seen.

**#6 Mental and physical health**. This takes a special place for me. Your wellbeing under all aspects is essential for us to work well, hence a priority for me regardless of what $COMPANY asks for. Do not hesitate in contacting me about things that might be bothering you.

## My commitments

* I honestly **care** about you, our team, and our mission. Think of me as your ally, at all times.
* I will candidly and constantly **challenge you** to achieve your goals and reach higher. Let's build an actionable plan together for all things improvable, even the ones that are already great.
* I expect you to openly **challenge me**, bring ideas, vocally disagree, as well as hold me and your peers accountable. Respectfully and elegantly, at all times.
* Your **health**, either physical or mental, is sacred. I will fight for you to be in your best moment and try to help you when you are not. (check Ground Rule #6)
* I strongly believe in **motivated individuals and cohesive teams**. My job is to make your job a great experience. I will not sacrifice results for cohesion, though. Expect me to give you clear feedback when things go off track.
* I will give you **more questions than answers**. This is a feature not a bug.

## Communication

![Alt text](img/comm.png?raw=true "Communication the secret is")

* **Fully present meetings.** If I am in a meeting with you, expect me to be all-in and connect at an (almost) human level. Personal or urgent topics should preferably be discussed in ad hoc calls.
* **Response time**. Due to time zone differences, I have a 24h SLA to respond to messages or email, although I will always try to reduce it. I might work in bizarre hours, so bear with me. You are in the top priority of my list, and I will always try to answer you ASAP.
* **Async over sync**. For mundane communication, Slack, dashboards, docs, spreadsheets tend to reduce the meetings overhead and speed up our results. Don't assume I am too busy, do reach out.
* **Automated updates**. I expect you to transparently document and update your metrics, progress and blockers (hint: automation ftw). I expect you to be in control of your tasks and results at all times. If I constantly need to ask you about this, we need to optimize the process. Remember Ground Rule #3.
* **Written over verbal**. I prefer written communication (i.e. emails, slack, etc). So, if you want to discuss or want me to do something, I’d encourage you to write me your points in advance. I will also never rarely schedule a meeting without an agenda.
* **Scheduled over random**. My calendar is open, feel free to book a slot. I prefer to take time to think, research, and digest a topic before discussing it. Use my agenda freely to book meetings. This does not apply for urgent or personal situations.
* **Clarity.** It is my responsibility to make things clear and actionable for you. It is your responsibility to reach out if something is unclear. Ask as many questions as you need. I will ask you multiple stupid questions until we both understand what is going on.
* **Why**. Context is king. I will default to transparently sharing information with you and make sure you understand why you are doing what you are doing. I won't lie to you about what is going on (sorry not sorry, $COMPANY).
* **What/how**. I will present the strategy and discuss the goal with you. Once we commit to the "what", I expect you to suggest the "how", which we will evaluate together as a team.
* **Effective over busy.** Busywork does not mean good work. I expect you to achieve your goals within the timelines we agree upon and within the highest standards. Where and when you do it are up to you, as long as you keep me posted (internal policies may apply).
* **Your voice _really_ matters.** I will listen to you, take notes, and consider your words deeply in my reflections. Your inputs are welcome and are an effective part of the decisions we make as a team.
* **Bring problems early**: If something is bothering you, please tell me ASAP. Either if it is money, a coworker, your neighbour, or especially me. If you take too long to tell me about an old problem, I might not be able to help you anymore. If you tell me everything is perfect I will assume something is wrong and keep asking annoying questions. Let's talk. Do not assume I understand what is going on (I probably don't).
* **Be cool**. I try to be respectful and mindful of everyone. Even if it is not reciprocal. Even if they share their 12345 password on Slack. I expect you to commit to respect and being civil as non-negotiables.

## Feedback and 1:1s

* **I love feedback**. I really do. I will give you this straight and right, on a timely, evidence-based, actionable manner. I expect you to do the same. That is the best gift you can give me.

* **Flexible feedback style.** I like to receive feedback as I like my steak: raw, fresh and bittersweet (yes, I have an odd taste for food). I will give you feedback whatever way you feel more comfortable with, as long as it is timely, clear and actionable.

* **Praise in public, criticize in private**. With few exceptions (i.e. unacceptable behaviors), and unless you state otherwise.

* **Shared agenda.** We will have a shared agenda for most of our meetings. I default to expect you to prepare in advance for these events, own these artifacts and document the highlights._Template example._ (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CA-XjoQ6f6emVIf0QVlSwju6fxYSSxc9H6v_mUNAb4c/edit?usp=sharing)

* **Our 1:1s are sacred.** I will try my best to have them fixed on a weekly-basis. These are *your* meetings, use them for anything you need. I might schedule ad-hoc meetings if I need to talk about specific issues. Feel free to do the same.

## Performance

* **Data-driven performance**. I will share in advance the main criteria and metrics I will use to evaluate your performance, as much as they’re available. We'll review it multiple times together along the way. If you are not aware of how you are performing at any moment, let me know.

* **Measure inputs, not outputs.** Bring metrics in and we won’t have to guess. Let's focus on what we can change and drop pointless complaints.

## Known failure modes

* I tend to over collaborate, which might confuse some people. Please let me know if the decision, feedback or any point is not clear enough.
* I might not be very attentive to details or forget some events. I heavily rely on shared written notes, agenda, and alerts to cope with my dislexic traits. Please help me review the details.
* My responsiveness rates tend to deteriorate to unacceptable levels. It is not personal and I am putting some serious effort here. Do call me out in case I am not complying with the SLAs above.
* I lean towards monologues. If I start speaking, I can literally keep going on for hours. Feel free to interrupt me and do speak up. Use the raise hand feature in our calls.

## About me

* I have no passion for tools, vendors, operating systems or text editors. I will pragmatically consider each case and try to choose the optimal solution (as long as we use Vim. Always.)
* I am an overall friendly and sociable person. Except when I am not. Don’t take it personally if I tell you I prefer to stay home doing nothing instead of going for a beer Friday night.
* I think in systems and mechanisms. Ad-hoc solutions are not consistent in most cases. This way of operating can create friction sometimes.
* I never saw GOT, Squid Games, Stranger Things, etc. Animes? Nope. Marvel stuff? I think I saw Daredevil with Ben Affleck ages ago. I know, right?
* I enjoy nerding out about philosophy over good Oolongs. Making sense is out of scope. I will try to keep my mouth shut if this does not interest you.
* I can be seriously interested in literally any topic from any perspective. The more unusual, the better. For real, picture a random subject and give it a try.
* I am addicted to reading. Disturbing books, mostly.
* Hair won’t be cut. Deal with it.
* Traveling, hiking, hearing about different cultures, arts, PS4 (I suck at it), cooking paella with wifey.
* I breathe security, especially offensive. I have spent an unreasonable amount of time chasing rabbit holes and debugging codes for missidentation.
